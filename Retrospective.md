## Experience

I struggled with getting the update command to work and getting the titles for my blog post. I kept running in circles researching online to see what I was doing wrong, when it turned out I just had to restart the localhost and my code was correct. There was nothing about this lab that was poorly explained. I was able to complete the entire project. I tried to get the making new posts to be on another page but after messing with making this work on pug for a while and not being successful, I scrapped the idea.

## Known issues or Bugs

None.

## Sources used

Geeksforgeeks.org This was a great resource for learning about pug and database integration. I use this website for my other classes a lot as there is a great knowledgebase for all topics and it helped me when I was confirming that I did the update command correctly.
